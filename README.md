**Objective:**

The primary objective of text summarization using word frequency is to automate the process of condensing lengthy texts into concise summaries. The approach aims to capture the most relevant information by giving higher importance to words that appear more frequently. This technique is particularly useful for quickly extracting key points from large volumes of text, making it easier for users to grasp the main ideas without going through the entire document.

In summary, the objective is to create an automated and efficient method for generating meaningful text summaries based on the frequency of words, providing a valuable tool for information retrieval and comprehension.
